# AUC_Black_Hat

Welcome to The AUC_BLACK_HAT github. This repo is inteded to serve as the repository for all AUC_Black_Hat essentials.

If this is your first time being here, I would suggest looking into the training resources branch, and look at the
basic hack study guide. It should give you a nice start if you are new to cybersecurity. 

If you have any questions feel free to also go to the discussion section and post it, or just start a discussion 
on anything that may come to mind. 

The goal here is to make a safe community to better expose like minded individuals into the worl of cybersecurity.

;) Have fun......
